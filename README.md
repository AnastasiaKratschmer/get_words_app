This is a silly, little app that will give you valid Danish words from letters you provide, containing a mandatory required letter. <br />
It will only give you letters of a length from four to seven, and in each word each each letter will occur only once. <br />
To run the app, download the repository and in yourterminal write: <br />
`cd get_words_app` <br />
`python3 get_words_app.py`. <br />
You will get a message  containing a link, which you can click to see the app locally deployed on your pc. <br />
You may need to download the python packages flask and pandas. <br /> <br />

This is a silly little not very serious app. <br/>
The wordlist was downloaded from https://ordregister.dk/, so thanks to them :)
